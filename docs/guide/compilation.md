# Compiling Circuits

Clifft compiles a supported [circuit input](circuit-inputs.md) into a reusable
`Program`. Compilation resolves Clifford coordinates, symbolic dependencies,
active-state transitions, and executable actions before sampling starts.

```text
circuit input -> parse -> trace to HIR -> optimize -> plan and prepare -> Program
```

Most users only need `clifft.compile()`. The lower-level functions expose the
same pipeline for inspecting intermediate representations or supplying a custom
optimization sequence.

## Default path

Pass circuit text directly to `clifft.compile()`:

```python
import clifft

program = clifft.compile("""
    H 0
    CNOT 0 1
    T 2
    M 0 1 2
""")
```

The returned program can be reused by ordinary sampling, survivor sampling,
fixed-fault importance sampling, or an exact-query API when the circuit meets
that API's requirements:

<!--pytest-codeblocks:cont-->

```python
result = clifft.sample(program, shots=1_000, seed=42)
```

Compilation options such as `postselection_mask`, `normalize_syndromes`,
`expected_detectors`, and `expected_observables` define the result contract
used during sampling.

For detector-based post-selection, set `normalize_syndromes=True` unless raw
measurement parities are intentional. Clifft computes the noiseless detector
and observable reference once during compilation and stores the normalization
in the program. `sample_survivors()` then applies the post-selection mask to
those normalized detector values; it does not recompute the reference per
call.

Leakage and loss take a trajectory-specific path. Pass the circuit and model
to `clifft.noncomp.sample()` rather than compiling one fixed program first; see
[Leakage and Loss](leakage-and-loss.md).

## Inspect or customize the pipeline

The following APIs are intended for power users working on compiler behavior,
custom optimization, or intermediate-representation inspection.

### Parse the circuit

`clifft.parse()` returns a `Circuit` without tracing or lowering it:

```python
import clifft

circuit = clifft.parse("H 0\nCNOT 0 1\nM 0 1")
```

Use `clifft.parse_file()` for a file, or the format-specific parsing functions
listed on [Circuit Inputs](circuit-inputs.md) for OpenQASM 2.

### Trace to the Heisenberg IR

`clifft.trace()` absorbs Clifford operations into an offline tableau and emits
explicit non-Clifford operations, measurements, noise, and classical outputs
in the Heisenberg frame:

```python
import clifft

hir = clifft.trace(clifft.parse("H 0\nCNOT 0 1\nT 0\nM 0 1"))
print(hir)
```

### Optimize the HIR

The default pass manager applies the same HIR optimization sequence used by
`clifft.compile()`:

```python
import clifft

hir = clifft.trace(clifft.parse("H 0\nCNOT 0 1\nT 0\nM 0 1"))
clifft.default_hir_pass_manager().run(hir)
```

Construct a focused pipeline when individual passes need to be controlled:

```python
import clifft

hir = clifft.trace(clifft.parse("H 0\nT 0\nM 0"))
passes = clifft.HirPassManager()
passes.add(clifft.PeepholeFusionPass())
passes.run(hir)
```

Pass `hir_passes=None` to `clifft.compile()` to skip HIR optimization while
keeping the one-step API.

### Plan and prepare execution

`clifft.lower()` converts an optimized `HirModule` into the same public
`Program` type returned by `clifft.compile()`:

```python
import clifft

hir = clifft.trace(clifft.parse("H 0\nT 0\nM 0"))
clifft.default_hir_pass_manager().run(hir)
program = clifft.lower(hir)
```

Internally, lowering first creates a semantic sampling plan that selects active
coordinates and records expressions, rotations, measurements, width
transitions, and outputs. Executable preparation then creates the immutable
descriptors and dependency tables used by the executor and selects supported
scalar or SIMD kernels.

These decisions happen before execution. Runtime kernels do not evolve a
tableau, choose coordinates, localize Paulis, or discover dependencies. See
[Software Architecture](../theory/architecture.md) for the contracts between
HIR, semantic planning, executable preparation, and shot execution.
