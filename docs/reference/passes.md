# Optimization Passes

Clifft's public optimization passes operate on the Heisenberg IR before
active-coordinate planning and executable-plan preparation.

## Default Pipeline

The default HIR pipeline:

{% for p in default_hir_passes %}
1. **{{ p['name'] }}** -- {{ p['summary'] }}
{% endfor %}

Use `clifft.default_hir_pass_manager()` to get these defaults, or build a
custom pipeline:

```python
import clifft

pm = clifft.HirPassManager()
pm.add(clifft.PeepholeFusionPass())
pm.add(clifft.StatevectorSqueezePass())
```

## Trajectory Safety Metadata

Some workflows require measurements to remain in their original order,
including hidden measurements introduced by the compiler. In particular,
`clifft.noncomp.sample` may force the result of a hidden trace-out measurement
when it resumes a trapped transition. Moving another measurement across that
collapse can change quantum correlations.

`clifft.noncomp.sample` therefore applies only passes that are enabled by
default, preserve measurement-record order, and preserve instrument prefixes.
Its HIR pipeline uses `PeepholeFusionPass` but omits
`StatevectorSqueezePass`.

Record-order preservation is necessary but does not by itself make a
continuation compatible with an already-running executor. Trajectory passes
must also opt in to instrument-prefix stability: changing the circuit after an
instrument may not change optimized output through that instrument. The
runtime checks each recompiled prefix before resuming. For this reason,
`clifft.noncomp.sample` uses a fixed internal
pipeline and does not currently accept custom pass managers. See
[Leakage and Loss](../guide/leakage-and-loss.md#why-there-is-no-compile-step)
for how continuations are compiled and resumed.

| **Preserves instrument prefix** | {{ 'Yes' if p['preserves_instrument_prefix'] else 'No' }} |
| **Python** | `clifft.{{ p['python_name'] }}()` |
